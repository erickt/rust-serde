//! Serde Serialization Framework
//!
//! Serde is a powerful framework that enables serialization libraries to generically serialize
//! Rust data structures without the overhead of runtime type information. In many situations, the
//! handshake protocol between serializers and serializees can be completely optimized away,
//! leaving serde to perform roughly the same speed as a hand written serializer for a specific
//! type.
//! 
//! For a detailed tutorial on the different ways to use serde please check out the
//! [github repository](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)
