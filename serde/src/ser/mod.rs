//! Generic serialization framework.
//! # For Developers who want to serialize objects
//! Implement the `Serialize` trait for the type of objects you want to serialize. Call methods of
//! the `serializer` object. For which methods to call and how to do so, look at the documentation
//! of the `Serializer` trait.
//!
//! # For Serialization Format Developers
//! Implement the `Serializer` trait for a structure that contains fields that enable it to write
//! the serialization result to your target. When a method's argument is an object of type
//! `Serialize`, you can either forward the serializer object (`self`) or create a new one,
//! depending on the quirks of your format.

/// A trait that describes a type that can serialize a stream of values into the underlying format.
///
/// # For `Serialize` Developers
/// Non-aggregate types like integers and strings can be serialized directly by calling the
/// appropriate function. For Aggregate types there's an initial `serialize_T` method that yields
/// a State object that you should not interact with. For each part of the aggregate there's a
/// `serialize_T_elt` method that allows you to pass values or key/value pairs. The types of the
/// values or the keys may change between calls, but the serialization format may not necessarily
/// accept it. The `serialize_T_elt` method also takes a mutable reference to the state object.
/// Make sure that you always use the same state object and only the state object that was returned
/// by the `serialize_T` method. Finally, when your object is done, call the `serialize_T_end`
/// method and pass the state object by value
///
/// # For Serialization Format Developers
/// If your format has different situations where it accepts different types, create a
/// `Serializer` for each situation. You can create the sub-`Serializer` in one of the aggregate
/// `serialize_T` methods and return it as a state object. Remember to also set the corresponding
/// associated type `TState`. In the `serialize_T_elt` methods you will be given a mutable
/// reference to that state. You do not need to do any additional checks for the correctness of the
/// state object, as it is expected that the user will not modify it. Due to the generic nature
/// of the `Serialize` impls, modifying the object is impossible on stable Rust.
